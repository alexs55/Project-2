**THE PROBLEM?**

Social media is great and does help develop human connection between people, but often at the expense of the more intimate human connections that occur when you physically sit with someone and have coffee or go out dancing together. People are at home chatting on Facebook instead of meeting a friend for dinner. 

**HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS?**
Our goal is to introduce a form of social media that is not a permanent place to talk, but solely an introduction. It is a place to find people within driving distance that you'll actually meet-up with and then take your friendship offline. In our application you only see posts that happen recently within a 15 minute drive from where you are.  

Here's the types of conversations we want to encourage: 
* "Hey I'm going dancing tonight at the Broken Spoke at 9pm, does anyone want to join?"
* "I'm looking for a running partner who wants to run before work around 6am. Let me know if you're interested!"
* "I'm 36 and single and looking to create a singles group! Maybe we can meet at Buzzmill Coffee weekly?"

All these conversations have the same goal in mind, real face-to-face connections. 

**HOW DOES IT WORK?**
Every post is tagged with the exact longitude and latitude of the user at that moment. The only people who see your posts are people within your immediate vicinity, and the only posts you see are from people in your vicinity. We only show you posts that are active and recent so you don't get bogged down with dead conversations that'll never lead to anything. Right now we have only the minimum viable product which allows users to post and see posts in their vicinity. Currently there is no logging in and all posts are anonymous although there is a field for username if you'd like to give your name. You can see a map of all the posts in your vicinity and click on each pin to see the post. This is a minimum viable product and there's tons of features to be added.

**HOW IT WAS BUILT?**
This project was built as a group project in the University of Texas' Full Stack Development Bootcamp. We used Javascript running on NodeJS for the backend. We utilized Express as our framework to make all the routes. The frontend was created using Bootstrap and Javascript. We utlized the Google Maps API to show all the user posts. The site was pushed live using heroku and is available at https://blooming-inlet-83635.herokuapp.com/
